    //In JavaScript, there are several data types including:
    //1. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
    //2. String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
    //3. Boolean: Represents a logical entity that can have two values: true or false.
    //4. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    //5. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.



    //JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. 
    //The data type is determined automatically based on the value assigned to the variable.
